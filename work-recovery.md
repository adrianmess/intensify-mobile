git commits from friday the 13th only show 2 hours of commit history
i know there was definitely more than 2 hours of work.
I think somewhere in the process of trying to migrate to a react-native folder and move the master to an intesify-old branch i deleted a copy of a folder that held the git commit history.

I'm currently going through my backups to see if i can restore folder i deleted that contained my git history
